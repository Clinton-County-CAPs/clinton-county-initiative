        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Clinton County Library District was established by the County Commissioners on October 10, 2024, per Section 182.015 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. The Commissioners defined the district as all of the county except the city limits of Cameron, where a municipal library district already exists through a city tax levy.</p>
        <p>Five residents — none of whom are elected officials — were appointed by the County Commissioners to the initial board to organize and raise the necessary resources to establish library services in the district. A tax levy supporting the district must be approved by the voters before services can be offered. A successful tax levy is also required before the district can pursue additional sources of private grants and other funding.</p>
        <p>Trustees serve four-year terms except the first trustees. Two are appointed for one year, one for two years, one for three years, and one for four years from July 1, 2025, in addition to their first few months. Annually thereafter, before July 1, the County Commission will appoint successors.</p>
        <p>The initial appointees represent a wide range of the county’s residents and include:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Christel Gollnick, President (Trimble, MO) - <a href="mailto:connect@clintoncountylibrary.org">connect@clintoncountylibrary.org</a></li>
